### About the Project ###

As it is included in the title, the project goal was to manage and research for a computing project which is associated with the process of improvising an existing application. The project main objectives for the students were 

- To develop a research report upon the feature addition for digital well-being for the users
- Establishing solid project goals, aims and objectives
- To gain capability to manage timeframes and the research process
- Solidify a specific milestones to complete the project aims and objectives to develop a feature

### Tools Appliance
- Microsoft Excel
- Google Form
- ProjectLibre


### What I have done

The module was strictly about managing a project where we need to implement a computing function into an existing portal. It introduced me about managing times, setting goals and scopes of the project and completing milestones according to a plan. Following that matter, here are few things that I have achieved which should be highlighted.

- Developed a oriented plan for the research project
- Created online survey to engage with customers
- Implemented WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), Gantt Chart for time management and critical path analysis for a working flow
- Concluded the process in a abstract for both personal development and the project

### Accomplishments

As far as I have described, there is not much to achieve as a language as I was managing a research project. On the other note, the majority of improvement was directed towards personal skill-sets. And these are few of the skill=sets that I have surely enhanced.

- Analytical skills
- Research skills
- Strategic skills
- Project Planning
- Risk assessment
- Collaboration
